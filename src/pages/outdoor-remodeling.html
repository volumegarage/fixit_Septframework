      <h2>Deck Construction that lasts -</h2>
      <p>
        Any outdoors environment is subject to the wear of Nature. At Mr. Fix
        It, we're building new decks all over East Tennessee that are sturdy and
        built to last. From strong supports to the finest woods and stain -
        you'll be happy with our work for years to come.
      </p>

      <h2>Screened Porches -</h2>
      <p>
        It's a cozy, bug free zone that keeps the pests of nature on the outside
        and the breeze and aroma of a fresh mountain air or shower up close.
        Check our our screen rooms for ideas for your concept.
      </p>

      <h2>Arbor Construction -</h2>
      <p>
        Arbors are a great addition for the gardner our a fine ambience to a
        stunning landscape.

      <h2>Hot Tub Covers and Platforms â€“</h2>
      <p>
        We don't cut corners when it comes to support a deck or screen porch
        that will last for years. If you've got some weight to hold - we build
        the foundation and supports for best reliability.
      </p>

      <h2>Roofing -</h2>
      <p>
        Roofs are our speciality. We built our business on a variety of
        different kinds too. Compliment your outdoor space with a great roof,
        cedar ceilings and much more.
      </p>

        Sometimes, a screen porch or deck needs to be remodeling to a complete
        room addition. See our additions for more ideas for your next project.
