testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        New modern kitchen remodel on Catawba Street in #KIngsport -
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Fix It have some creative couples we work for and this recent
        farmhouse kitchen remodel was a dream job. Working together, we revised
        this kitchen with a nostalgic farmhouse sink with subway backsplash and
        an accent wall. This new home experience is accented with Akia cabinetry
        and elegant quartz counter tops.
