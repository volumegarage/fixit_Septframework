testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        This amazing new kitchen in Ridgefields is ready for holiday
        entertaining.

        Shenandoah cabinets of plywood construction are accented by matching
        stage crown moulding. We installed premium granite counter taps with a
        matching glass mosaic backsplash.

        There’s 12×24 porcelain floor tile with custom range hood and a pass
