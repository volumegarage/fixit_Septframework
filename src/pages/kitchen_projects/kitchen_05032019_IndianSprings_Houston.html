testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        We're proud of this new kitchen in Blountville. Here are some more
        photos from this complete remodel.

        Mr. Fix It put up new sheet rock all around, installed pre-hung doors,
        night lights with blinds and a new door with blinds. A refreshing Acura
        Luxury vinyl flooring is accented by Carolina Heartwood kitchen base and
        wall cabinetry for a fresh new look.
      </p>

        Finally, it's all complimented by steel gray granite with subway tile
        backsplash and LED lighting for an updated kitchen to compliment a new
        generation of family memories.
