testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        As a contractor, there's nothing better than former customers trusting
        you to build their interior design ideas. This new kitchen was a
        complete makeover from a former client in Colonial Heights. We
        transformed their bath, and now they are enjoying a brand new kitchen.

        We went top to bottom on this one too. We removed the old popcorn
        texture on the ceiling of the kitchen and most of the downstairs of this
        home and applied a smooth finish and replaced all the lightening with
        LED can lights.
      </p>

        The cabinets make a difference in those home. Before we started, we
        primed and painted all the walls. Once that was completed with removed
        the old cabinets and replaced them with new American Woodmark designs
        with Newport painted square doors and a hazelnut glaze. All of the
        drawers all self-closing dove-tail drawers and topped with a fantasy
        brown colored granite countertop.

        The glow to this kitchen comes from the new 3"x 6" Subway tile. Finally,
        the clean look is complimented by new baseboard and shoe board around
        the kitchen with two coats of semi-gloss paint on the trim.
