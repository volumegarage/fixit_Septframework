testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        We've completed a number of interior projects for this home in Preston
        Forest over the years
      </p>
      <p>
        This large kitchen has elegant white cabinetry accented by granite
        countertops and a subway tile backsplash. We created a sidebar counter
        for entertaining and mosaic tile accents along the walls.
      </p>
      <p>
        All appliances are precisely integrated into the cabinetry and corners
        to provide a open-spaced kitchen for food preparation, and family
        conversations.
