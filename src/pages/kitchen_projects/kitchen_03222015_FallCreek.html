testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        Transforming a basement can be tricky, but together, Mr. Fix It and
        recent clients on Fall Creek Road came together to accomplish an
        impressive remodel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The downstairs plan was updated with a bedroom, bath with walk-on
        shower, a new kitchen and an entertainment / movie room. In addition,
        thereâ€™s a living space with a walkway right outside to the pool making
        this new addition a perfect downstairs getaway.
