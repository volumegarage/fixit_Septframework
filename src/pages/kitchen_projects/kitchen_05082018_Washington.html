testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        Small kitchen? Doesn't have to be. Mr. Fix It Home Improvements can turn
        any kitchen into an amazing family gathering spot.

        Look at this house built in the 1950s. Located in Kingsport, we
        completely gutted the old kitchen. We also replaced all the plumbing,
        removed the flooring and replaced the old linoleum with elegant white
        tile. There's new plywood Carolina Heartwood cabinetry and we removed an
        old exit door for more cabinets and opened the kitchen up more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Black granite countertops are complimented by clean white subway tile
        backsplash. We even added a new disposal and dishwater to modernize this
        stunning clean kitchen.
