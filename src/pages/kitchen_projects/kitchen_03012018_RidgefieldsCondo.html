testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        Room-to-Room and Top-to-Bottom Remodeling. Whatever the condition, Mr.
        Fix It Home Improvements can completely transform your home. The
        "before" pictures of this condo show one of the most damaged properties
        in Kingsport. After Mr. Fix It, it's one of Kingsport's most modern
        condos on the market.

        From new windows and doors to hardwood floors, we've finished
        everything. There's a new bathroom, kitchen and much more to this home
        in Ridgefields and this home is ready for Spring!
      </p>
      <p>
        From the outside, we installed new Atrium double-hung vinyl windows. We
        also removed a rotten outside deck and replaced with Cox dry-treated
        lumber with new stain and a vinyl handrail.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the first steps inside, you'll notice gorgeous 3 1/4” x3/4” red-oak
        hardwood flooring throughout. We primed all the walls, ceilings and trim
        and applied two coats of paint throughout for a fresh wall-to-wall
        appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also renovated one and a half baths with brushed nickel plumbing and
        porcelain tile and striking new granite countertops in both bathrooms
        and the kitchen. The kitchen also has a tile backsplash to accent the
        new stainless appliances with new lighting throughout. Call Mr. Fix It
        today and let's discuss your new home remodeling project this year. Free
