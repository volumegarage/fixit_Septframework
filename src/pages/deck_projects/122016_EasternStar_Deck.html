testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

   <p>Here's a brand new sunroom and extension from Mr. Fix It - We just finished this gorgeous 20'x16' Sunroom with a one car garage that includes an insulated 9'x7' Regency garage door. The garage has a matching brick foundation to match the rest of the home and appear as if it was built to spec. 
     
    <p>The sunroom at top features Pella 350 aluminum clad double hung windows with low E glass wood. We also installed 2" x 6" wall framing with R-19 wall insulation to keep in the heat and the a/c during theSummer. </p>
    <p>Underneath is a 20" x 20" Ayers Rock full body porcelain floor tile installed in a diamond pattern. Outside - there's a 16' x 16' open deck with landing and steps. Walking up to the upper level, are solid 1" round black ballisters on a 4" center. Just in time for the holidays, this is going to make a great perch to welcome Spring in 2017. Call Mr. Fix It today for a free estimate at your home.</p>
