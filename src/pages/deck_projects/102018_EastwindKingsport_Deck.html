testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        A great home is better with a screen room addition from Mr. Fix It.
      </p>
      <p>
        This recent job in Kingsport expanded a 18'x12' room to a new dimension
        of 18'x18' Screen Room. 18’x12’to start. The cedar accents include a 4x4
        support post, 2x10 beams for room trusses with a 6/12 pitch. We used
        Architectural shingles to match the homes existing roof and added 3"
        knee walls with cedar framing and aluminum black ballasters for east
        viewing.
      </p>

        There's also an insulated ceiling with a gorgeous 1"x8" tongue and
        groove pine ceiling with covering beams and inside gables. Finally, to
        accent the outside, there's a Larson Tradewinds storm door with roll-up
        screen along with matching railing, and 44" wide steps - finished with
        new gutters and down spouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fall is a great time to plan your new screen room. Cool nights, warm
        coffee and family gatherings will never be the same.
