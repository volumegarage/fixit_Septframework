testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        Do you have a deck that is old or worn out? Mr. Fix-It recently replaced
        a small deck addition in Johnson City. The original deck was 19×12, and
        the owner wanted a new addition that would support a Jacuzzi Hot Tub.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our team went to work and constructed a spectacular new 19' x 26′ deck
        with additional supports for a 10′ x 10′ area with an added joist
        system. We special-ordered 20′ 5.4″x6″ floor decking to eliminate all
        seams for an added finishing touch.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also removed vinyl siding and installed channel rustic wood on the
        main house wail and continued the interior by buildout out a 1″x8″
        tongue and groove continuous cedar ceiling. There’s even an open gable
        on the roof with a cedar finish and nice mount and outset for a
        big-screen tv for those nights in the hot tub.
      </p>

      <p>
        This custom deck also includes round black balusters with a sandwiched
        hand-tailing that is sturdy while walking up to an 8’x8′ landing for an
        outside grill.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’ll be surprised at how much a new deck can improve the value and
        enjoyment of your new home. Reimagine the outdoors and give Mr. Fix It
        Home Improvements a call today and let’s talk about a new deck for you.
