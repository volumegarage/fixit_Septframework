testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        A new deck is part of the good life here in East TN. From sunrise to
        sunsets and mountain breezes and summer fireflies â€“ conversations are
        never the same.

        Here's a new deck we finished recently in Church Hill. This 16'x12'
        screened enclosure is like two decks in one. There's an 8'x12' open deck
        for grill gear and both accessed by two stair sets that are 4' wide and
        a 4'x4' landing.
      </p>
      <p>
        We started by removing an old deck and replaced the footings with 6"x6"
        posts with footings. The new deck was crafted on a 2x10 frame with
        matching joist on a 16" center. This deck is built to last too. All
        material is Cox#1 dry-treated lumber - from the frame, flooring, steps
        and railing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This paradise one step from the back door is accented by black aluminum
        balusters constructed as part of knee walls on both the flat railing and
        step rails. Let Mr. Fix It give you a free estimate on that old deck, or
        let's discuss a new one. After all, life is worth it. Enjoy your home
        like never before.
