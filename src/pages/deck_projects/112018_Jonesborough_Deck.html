testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        Just in time for the holidays, Mr. Fix It Home Improvements recently
        completed a gorgeous screen porch, deck and outdoor sanctuary for a home
        nestled in the foothills of Jonesborough.
      </p>
      <p>
        This one has it all too - if you want to stay on a screen porch -
        there's a place for that. If you're going to sit outside in the sun -
        there's room for that. If you plan on sharing family time under the
        arbor cooking steaks or soaking in a hot tub, there's room for that too!
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a small deck that was on the home in the beginning. Working
        with our client, we envisioned a new 16' x 16' screen enclosure with a
        cathedral ceiling, solid deck flooring and vinyl siding on both sides
        with knee walls. Above, there's a 1x8" tongue in groove pine ceiling
        with accented with matching architectural shingles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside, the deck has several points of interest and are matched
        perfectly with coverage that measures 16’x10’, 20’x8’, 12’x10’ and 2x10.
        There are solar caps with a luminous accent - all atop 6" by 6" post
        footings for a perfectly solid foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The centerpiece of this project is a stunning arbor with scalloped ends,
        2”x2”s on 8” center and 6”x6” post with footings.
      </p>
      <p>
        To complete the outside addition, there is recessed a 3/4”x4’x8’
        pressure treated lattice for complete underpinning. Unique accents also
        include black aluminum 3/4” black balusters with treated 2x4 top and
        bottom railing and solar caps for lumination accents at night. Ready to
        discuss your project?
