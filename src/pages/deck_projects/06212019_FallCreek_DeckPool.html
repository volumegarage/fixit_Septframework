testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        It's always humbling and rewarding to work with repeat customers.

        This brand new deck on Fall Creek Road in Kingsport was a complete
        demolition from an old outdoor deck to a 19' x 12' screen enclosure that
        included a 2x10 floor system on a 6" x 6" post. Now that's a robust
        support system and will last for many years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The floor inside the screen room is Trexx decking with Cox Dry-Treated
        framing and stained new walls. Our team constructed a stick framing for
        the shed roof and built a vaulted ceiling with tongue and groove stained
        1"x8" pine for a greater sense of space.
      </p>
      <p>
        The landing from the pool to the screen room is 14' x 4' with two sets
        of 4' steps. The framing is dry-treated for long wear outside and has
        step treads and step risers. As a final touch, we installed black
        aluminium balusters encased with stained rail framing and knee walls all
        around.
