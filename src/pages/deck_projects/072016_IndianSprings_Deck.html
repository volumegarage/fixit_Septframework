testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        Located in Indian Springs, this new deck was completely rebuilt from the
        ground up.
      </p>

      <p>
        What started as 16' x 12' deck was designed and crafted with the owner
        to result in a 30' x 18' deck with an open floor plan. It could be three
        decks in one and features a gable roof and a low slope roof with
        complete cedar ceilings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built on a heavy-duty load bearing tongue and groove beams, this deck is
        solid. The lower deck has round metal ballisters and 2 sets of steps to
        walk up to the main deck. There's plenty of room for outdoor dining as
        the grill has an open space away from seating areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        This beautiful outdoor space is certain to improve the value of this
        beautiful home and the relaxation and serenity provided by this new
        addition. Call Mr. Fix It Home Improvements today are contact us on
