testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        Nothing like a glass of tea or cup of coffee with family and friends on
        this new front porch in Colonial Heights
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Fix It started this project from the ground up and when we were
        finished, this home had a 19' x 6' porch that will last for generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        To start the project, we removed a wooden front porch and excavated the
        original entrance to dig concrete footings and install 8" blocks. Once
        the foundation was in place, we finished the look with matching brick
        finish.
      </p>
      <p>
        On top, we framed a 19'x6' floor with dry-treated deck flooring and
        constructed 4' wide steps up to the porch with step backings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The floor of this new porch is accented by TWP wood sealer and has for
        8" square aluminum fluted columns with black aluminum porch and step
        railings.
