        Nothing like a glass of tea or cup of coffee with family and friends on
        this new front porch in Colonial Heights
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Fix It started this project from the ground up and when we were
        finished, this home had a 19' x 6' porch that will last for generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        To start the project, we removed a wooden front porch and excavated the
        original entrance to dig concrete footings and install 8" blocks. Once
        the foundation was in place, we finished the look with matching brick
        finish.
      </p>
      <p>
        On top, we framed a 19'x6' floor with dry-treated deck flooring and
        constructed 4' wide steps up to the porch with step backings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The floor of this new porch is accented by TWP wood sealer and has for
        8" square aluminum fluted columns with black aluminum porch and step
        railings.
