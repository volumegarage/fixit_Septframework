testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        Mr. Fix It enjoyed watching this transformation in a backyard in Preston
        Forest. We completely removed an old 38'x 12' deck and set the 6"x6"
        post footings to bring to life this new open deck and screen porch
        combination.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 2"x10" floor system with floor joists and has dry-treated deck
        flooring for long-lasting, sturdy construction.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a great roof over part of the deck that serves as a warm patio.
        The framed 2x8 roof system has a 2x10 wall ledger set with 4x4 posts and
        3.5"x10" beams over the posts. The roof itself has roof sheathing, felt,
        architectural singles with wall flashing and vinyl soffit and fascia for
        an exterior finish. We've even insulated the roofing with R-19
        insulation and completed the interior finish with a cedar ceiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of the porch, the deck is an open design and wraps around to an
        exterior entrance. It's covered from top to bottom with two coats of TWP
        wood sealer and accented by Afco aluminum black railings between all
        posts and step railings.
