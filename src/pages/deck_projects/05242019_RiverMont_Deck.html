testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        Spring has sprung, and Summer is on its way! Mr. Fix It just wrapping up
        another deck in Kingsport, and the views of Bays Mountain are awesome on
        this new 30x12 deck with 6”x6” support post with footings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like most decks, the years had taken this toll, and we completely
        redesigned this deck with a 2x10 frame, with matching joist on 16”
        center with joist hangers.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the back yard, you walk up two sets of 4' steps and a 4'x4'
        landing. There are handrails consistent with top and bottom rails and
        5/8" aluminum balusters and bracket connectors for extra stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also applied redwood stain to the handrails before the installation
        and postponed the rest of the stain as the new wood sets in the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the top, there's a solid 5/4”x6”x 12’ premium deck flooring and a
        framed 12'x6' cantilevered upstairs deck with a matching rail system
        outside the bedroom.
      </p>
      <p>
