testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        Summer's are better on a new deck from Mr. Fix It Home Improvements.
        Upgrade that deck into something amazing!
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a recent build in Blountville that features a 32’x12’ cedar
        composite deck and composite handrail - it's built to last. There's a
        new Duxx Baxx water shedding, deck system that keeps water moving and
        all made from high-fade resistant, non-vinyl composite. There's dry
        storage below and fire pit colored trailing with square aluminum
        ballusters and two matching aluminum gates with matching hardware.
      </p>

        This is an awesome pool perch and the observation deck for plenty of
        starlit nights and rose-colored sunsets. Call or message Mr. Fix It
        today to get a free quote on your new deck.
