testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        Mr. Fix It recently looked at a deck in Kingsport that had a
        sub-standard frame and post. The original size was 20' x 16' and was
        simply out - dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were excited to work with the owners to reimagine this new deck and
        enlarging it to 22' x 16' construction with 20" x 20" post footings. We
        installed 6" x 6" post footings and a 2" x 10' floor system on a joist
        on a 16" center with joist hangers. Now that's a lot, but what it means
        - it's sturdy and will last a long, long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We finished the job with premium 5/4" x 6" and 16" deck flooring with 1"
        aluminum black balusters with a 2x4 top rail. There are also two sets of
        steps with a 4'x4' landing. Another job well-done just in time for those
        Summer sunsets as this deck looks westward from Stuffle Heights in
        Kingsport.
      </p>
      <p>
        Give Mr. Fix It a call, or reach out to us on Facebook. We'll be happy
        to give you a free estimate and a new deck for your outside paradise.
