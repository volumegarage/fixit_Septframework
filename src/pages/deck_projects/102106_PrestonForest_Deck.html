testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

      We recently completed an amazing new 20' x 20' deck in Preston Forest that
      has composite flooring installed with hidden fasteners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon sun looks great too on this outdoor area that has a 20'
      a-roof with a complete vinyl finish. There are wooden hand rails around
      and has all the comforts for fall in place to watch television, entertain
      and quiet moments with a book - all in your backyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody does it better! Call Mr. Fix It today and let's look at your
      backyard project.
