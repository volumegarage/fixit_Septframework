        If your home has more than one bathroom that needs remodeling, Mr. Fix
        It is ready to deliver amazing results.
      </p>
      <p>
        This recent 3-bathroom remodeling project in Kingsport brought a modern
        and refreshing distinction to this new home in Preston Forest.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you first walk into the new master bath, you'll find a new 4'x4'
        tiled shower, with 12"x24" porcelain wall tile and a matching shower
        floor. Above, the 10" Delta rain head, plus a wall-mounted shower faucet
        is the main attraction in this retreat.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you like a little slower pace, there's an Ove stand along tub with a
        floor mounted faucet. Along the wall, our centerpiece for this bath is
        two 48" all plywood, custom-made vanity cabinets accented by 44"x36"
        white vanity mirrors, plus four new lights. The granite countertop is a
        compliment by Moen 8" spread brushed nickel faucets and top things off,
        we have installed 4 5/8" crown molding all around.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other smaller bathrooms have a similar design and been complimented
        by their differences. Both of these baths have a Delta four-piece
        tub-shower units with Delta BJ tub-shower faucets. These bathrooms also
        have all plywood custom-made vanity cabinets and Delta faucets with
        complementing brushed nickel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each bath has new caledonia granite stone with side and backsplash for a
        consistent, elegant and functional style for today's most modern home
        life.
      </p>
