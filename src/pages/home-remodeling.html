      <p>
        Whatever you imagine, Mr. Fix It is ready to work. As a local
        contractor, we work with our clients to get to know their goals, their
        timeline and budget. Over the years, we have worked with a wide variety
        of projects - from simple jobs to complete home makeovers. If your home
        or property needs a facelift or you just need a little more room for
        that special sunroom, bathroom or garage, we're ready to get started
        with your home expansion.
      </p>

      <blockquote>Add-Ons to Your Home Remodeling Project</blockquote>

      <h2>Basement Remodeling -</h2>
      <p>
        Basements can become complete living areas, an entertainment room,
        fitness center and much more.
      </p>

      <h2>Room or home Additions -</h2>
      <p>
        From the ground up, Mr. Fix It can transform your home into something
        new and even add on a new living area for relatives or rental
        investments.
      </p>

      <h2>Garage Construction -</h2>
      <p>
        How about some more space to park the car and store the outdoor gear. A
        new garage is possible and how about a new sunroom on top?
      </p>

      <h2>Outdoor Kitchens -</h2>
      <p>
        Some of our best outdoor projects have been additions to install outdoor
        kitchens for barbecues, entertainment and full bar access
      </p>

      <h2>Flooring -</h2>
      <p>
        Your flooring choices are better than ever with Mr. Fix It. From
        traditional custom hardwood floor, precise fit-lock vinyl, our flooring
        projects are impressive and affordable.
      </p>

      <h2>Drywall -</h2>
      <p>
        It's the little things that make the difference with Home Improvement
        and our drywall team is one of the best around.
      </p>

      <h2>Fireplace Replacements -</h2>
      <p>
        Got an old fireplace in need of repair? Let Mr. Fix It re-imagine the
        old hearth with a new gas insert and more.
