testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        Here's another great bathroom makeover by Mr. Fix It Home Improvements.
      </p>
      <p>
        You wouldn't believe the transformation. We laid the groundwork with 6"
        by 48" plank floor tiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Installed new Kraftmaid white cabinetry, a quartz countertop over a
        double vanity with Delta Chrome Faucets.
      </p>
      <p>
        There used to be a partition wall between vanity and commode and we
        reframed with a 42" framed capped wall capped with quartz to open up
        more depth in the bath.
      </p>
      <p>
        The centerpiece of the room is a brand new 72" x 36" Koehler Archer
        Drop-In Soaker tub flanked by a glass walk-in shower with 3"x12" subway
        tile.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of this complimented by staged crown molding on the ceiling. The
        bathrooms just keep getting better all over the Tri-Cities. Give Mr. Fix
