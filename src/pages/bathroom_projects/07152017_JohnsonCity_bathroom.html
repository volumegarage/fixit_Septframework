        Mr. Fix It hopes you are enjoying a great Summer! With fall and winter
        coming soon, it's a good time to consider remodeling your home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a small bedroom that was converted into a modern new bath. This
        tiny bedroom was converted into an elegant bath with custom-made 33"
        dual solid wood vanities with 8" spread Moen sink faucets. Granite
        countertops and a 48" x 34" Kohler four-piece shower unit.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a frameless Kohler sliding shower door too accented by solid
        pine raised panel pocket door with wash area and 12" x 24" porcelain
        floor tile.
