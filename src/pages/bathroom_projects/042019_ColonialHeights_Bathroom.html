        Just finished another gorgeous renovation of a new master bath and half
        bath in Kingsport.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was a complete demo and we moved some things around too. We
        removed a partition wall, relocated the commode and installed a custom
        walk-in shower at 72" x 34" and complimented everything with a subtle
        gray finish Dal-tile and porcelain tile throughout.
      </p>
      <p>
        The frameless sliding glass door steps out into a matching floor tile
        and new cabinetry. The cabinets are made by Kraftmaid and solid plywood
        construction with elegant granite countertop. We even replaced the
        interior doors to accent this brand-new bath.
      </p>

        great estimate too. Call today or contact Mr. Fix It at our website and
