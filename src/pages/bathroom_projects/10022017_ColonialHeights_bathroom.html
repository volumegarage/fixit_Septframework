testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        We love showing off what happens when Mr. Fix works with great clients
        to remodel an old bathroom into an amazing showcase.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a large bathroom, but the new layout and quality
        craftsmanship is second to none. Remodeled from the ground up, we moved
        a closet door and relocated a commode.
      </p>

      <p>
        From there, we laid down solid porcelain 12" x 24" tile and built a new
        walk-in shower with 12" x 12" wall tile with a matching brick pattern.
        On the floor are 4 1/4" baseboards. The centerpiece is a Normandy Color
        Granite countertop on top of Kraftmaid solid wood cabinetry accented by
        a linen closet.
