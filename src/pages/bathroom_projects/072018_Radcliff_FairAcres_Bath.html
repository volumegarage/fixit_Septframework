        We make old bathrooms radiant! Whatever fits your lifestyle, a double
        shower, a new closet, new flooring, new tile â€¢ Mr. Fix It Home
        Improvements has got you covered.
      </p>
      <p>
        We just recently finished a new project in Kingsport that's one of a
        kind. This three-room project was a complete recreation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We used a four-piece Kraftmaid cabinet with a raised panel door in
        Montclair Kaffe color. Granite countertops in venician ice with
        rectangular almond colored under-mount sinks. The centerpiece is an 84"
        by 44" custom tiled shower with two wall niches, and two Delta Linden
        wall mounted 2-in-1 shower heads.
      </p>
      <p>
        The flooring is Duomo porcelain in 12" and 24" tile inside the shower
        and complimented by Devonshire almond color tile everywhere else
        including the master closet remodel in this project. All water featured
        for sinks, showers and soak-in tub are brushed nickel with matching
        accessories throughout.
      </p>
      <p>

        detail and would love to provide a free estimate for you project!
