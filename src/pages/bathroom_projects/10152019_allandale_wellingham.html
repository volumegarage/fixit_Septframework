        This recent project near Allandale in Kingsport is another favorite.
        Imagine reading a book or preparing for a night out in this new
        bathroom.

        When we began, we removed partition walls that were part of the old bath
        and installed new Porada soft taupe color solid porcelain on the floor.
        For the centerpiece, we installed on Ove stand-alone bathtub with
        matching tile backsplash.

        Behind the tub, there's a new 66x36 styled shower designed with help
        from our client with a bench seat and 2 wall benches. The shower has
        custom glass with 1 end panel and 2 glass panels with hinged doors.
        Along the walls, we set vanity cabinets and installed Kismire ivory
        granite counter tops with under mount sinks all complimented with Delta
        brushed nickel plumbing for an elegant and timeless bath.
