        When it comes to updating a bathroom, Mr. Fix It enjoys working with
        projects like this one. This beautiful home had an outdated bathroom
        with a large garden tub and pink colors from a former owner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, it's gorgeous, and the owners love their new bath with have
        something to be proud of for years to come from Mr. Fix It Home
        Improvements.
      </p>
      <p>
        We remodeled everything from the ground up. Our team replaced the old
        linoleum with 12x12" floor tile with a diamond pattern in both bathrooms
        â€“ a half bath downstairs and a full bath upstairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the master bath, we removed the large garden tub and started to work
        on the improvements. We remove an access door from the bedroom to extend
        the vanity from a 48' single bowl to a 96' double bowl. Working with the
        homeowner, we crafted 8' of custom cabinetry to replace the old
        cabinets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new bath is a Kohler 60' x 32' Archer series tub with 12"x12" wall
        tile on a brick pattern with brushed nickel water fixtures for a modern
        and functional design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Downstairs, we installed two custom cabinets, and a vessel bowl with a
        single pole Delta brushed nickel faucet. We also installed Santiago
        granite in the half bath to accent the design of the guest room
        facility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both bathrooms are accented by elegant 3 5/8" crown molding with 5 1/4"
        speed based with shoe mold.
