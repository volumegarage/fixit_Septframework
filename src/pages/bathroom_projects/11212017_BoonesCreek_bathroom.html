        There's nothing like a repeat customer!

      <p>
        Mr. Fix It is proud to introduce another custom bathroom remodel in
        Boones Creek, TN. This project included a complete reno of an old
        bathroom with new cabinets, flooring, tile, fixtures and extending a
        walk-in closet.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also installed distressed five-inch hickory hardwood flooring
        proceeding into the bathroom with Dakota Rustic door that opens to a new
        master bath. The walls are sprayed with a complete texture knockdown and
        ceiling finish which sets apart the floors and the cabinetry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The detail and quality are accented by plywood construction using
        Kraftmade birch cabinetry with extraordinary wood grains in the finish.
        This all sits on top of full body porcelain Atlantis tile for both the
        floors and wall in an almond bardolino color.
      </p>
      <p>
        We enjoyed working with the client to create a custom linen closet and
        base cabinet too. The spacious shower has complementary Atlantis floor
        tile and a rain-head shower unit. To accent the lighting, we also
        lowered the ceiling and brought the skylight more into view and designed
        crown molding throughout to set off the final touch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Call Mr. Fix It today and let's re-create a new dream bath for you and
        your family.
