        Here's one of our recent favorites. This bathroom remodel replaced a
        jacuzzi with a 72xc26 drop-in tub and custom-tiled shower all accented
        by Tiger Wood plank tile for an elegant european finish.

        The walk-in shower is a 60x40 glass enclosure with custom Kohl faucets
        including a handheld unit hear the tiled bench. This open bathroom
        features black Craftmade cabinetry with granite counter tops and we even
        made it bigger by reducing a couple of feet from a walk-in closet.

        one of our finest yet. Call Mr. Fix today or contact us Facebook to talk
