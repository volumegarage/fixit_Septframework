testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        Imagine your new bath by experienced pros at Mr. Fix It.
      </p>
      <p>
        This recent remodel in Kingsport transformed 2 and 1/2 baths from a
        historic outdated design into a modern showcase that adds value to any
        home.
      </p>
      <p>
        We started with Diamond Prelude solid wood cabinetry throughout with a
        coconut color with grey stone glaze. In the master bath, we installed a
        stunning quartz countertop in Santiago finish. The centerpiece is a grey
        stone porcelain shower with matching mosaic tile on the tub walls.
      </p>
      <p>
        We finished the room with brushed nickel rain heads and shower fixtures
        along with Delta 8" series sink faucets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire room is accented by elegant wainscotting on each wall. The
        second full has black matte granite countertops and a Kohler Archer
        Biscuit finish tub. The half bath was finished with a stunning
        butcher-block counter with a white vessel bowl with Delta bright brass
        single pole faucet and accessories and as a final touch an Orleans
        mosaic floor tile.
