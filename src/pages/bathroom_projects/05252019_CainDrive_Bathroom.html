        When you open the door to this new bathroom by Mr. Fix It - the first
        thing you notice is the craftsmanship and design. The attention to
        detail and the floor plan makes this one of our best yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        We removed the garden tub and now when you walk in you see the
        centerpiece - a 66" x28" x26" Ove Stand alone Tub with Delta mounted
        faucets and a hand spray that capture the room with light from the
        treetops and a bay window.
      </p>
      <p>
        We removed the old shower unit and crafted and a new 4'x38" title shower
        installed with a Kohler frameless sliding shower door.
      </p>
      <p>
        We widened the closet to 48" and added a bi-fold door for better
        organization of toiletries and towels.
      </p>
      <p>
        We removed all of the oak cabinetry and installed custom plywood white
        cabinetry with Taj Mahjal quartz vanity countertops. Our team also
        mounted double vanities accented by Delta brushed nickel 8" spread sink
        faucets.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also added recessed can lightning, two separate wall mirrors with a
        decorative sconce to complete the accents.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire bath includes custom 4 and 5/8" crown molding with a 4 1/4"
        molded base and shoe mold. We pulled up all the linoleum and replaced it
        with elegant 12 "x24" porcelain tile and painted all the doors, trim and
        windows with oil-based enamel for a fresh, modern and luxurious
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we can't say enough about great clients. It's a pleasure to
        work on projects like this, and we take great pride in our work and our
        relationships.
