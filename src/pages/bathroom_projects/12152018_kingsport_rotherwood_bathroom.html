testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

      <p>2019 begins with a brand new bath in Rotherwood Estates.</p>

      <p>
        We started by removing an out-dated tub and shower unit, gutting all
        cabinetry, flooring, and lighting for a complete makeover. Working with
        the homeowner, we selected only the best cabinetry and tile. The Diamond
        cabinetry is all maple wood with an elegant cloud color. The bath now
        has two new 48" vanities, a 24" knee drawer and two counter-mounted
        storage cabinets. These cabinets can store everything from towels to
        toiletries and measure 15"x12"x48".
      </p>

      <p>
        To accent the bath, we also installed a stunning new granite countertop
        with under rectangular mount sinks. All of this work is accented by an
        8" spread Delta Leland sink faucets with a BN finish and three framed
        mirrors and vanity lights.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the old tub unit was removed, we installed a brand new Koehler
        Archer Tub with Delta 2-1 BN faucet. All around the tub is Marazzi
        Archeology 13"x13" wall tile with a custom wall niche.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of this new work sits atop a perfect bathroom floor with 12"x24"
        tile with a brick pattern. From top-to-bottom, Mr. Fix It Home
        Improvements is your best locally owned and operated choice for custom
