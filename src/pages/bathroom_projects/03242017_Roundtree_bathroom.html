        Mr. Fix It Home Improvements is transforming bathrooms all across the
        Tri-Cities. Working with creative ideas from our client in Johnson City,
        we transformed this home into something amazing.
      </p>

      <p>
        What began as outdated baths and a bedroom constructed in the 70s became
        an elegant modern living space that adds value to this immaculate home.
        Mr. Fix transformed a bedroom into a walk-in closet and an additional
        washroom with a hall entry.
      </p>
      <p>
        We constructed a gorgeous glass shower with tiled niche, rain shower
        faucets and a 80″ x 44″ glass shower door. We used TigerWood planked
        tile throughout and a double vanity separate by a convenient linen
        closet to compliment the spacious new master bath.
      </p>

      <p>
        A second bath was transformed into a stunning clean smaller bath with
        12″ x 24″ floor tile, a shower decorated with subway tile and accented
        with a pebble mosaic niche. There’s Kraftmade cabinetry with granite
        countertops too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, a third bath was redesigned with a warm glossy tile finish for
        the bath and floors alike. We accented the work with an oil-rubbed
        bronze finish and new lightening.
      </p>

        Watch our video on Facebook and see how we converted old style bathrooms
        into elegant living spaces and added a walk-in closet and laundry room.
