        This home had a shower unit and had a small layout at 8'x54", but the
        remodel made a big difference. Located in Preston Forest of Kingsport,
        this project was a complete tear-out to the stud walls.
      </p>
      <p>
        We removed the shower unit and replaced it with a tiled shower that
        added six more inches. The shower now measures 54"x34" with a matching
        frameless oil-rubbed bronze sliding shower door.

      <p>
        There's plenty of new tile too. We removed the old decorations and
        molding and replaced them with 12"x12" tile from floor to ceiling. We
        also installed matching tile on the floor and finished the work with 3
        5/8" crown molding.
