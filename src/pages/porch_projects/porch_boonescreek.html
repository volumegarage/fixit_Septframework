testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        This beautiful home located on a Blountville Farm was recently remodeled
        to a modern kitchen complete with an open floor plan that leads into
        both a family room and dining room.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the stunning hardwood floor, to the details of the fireplace that
        was customized to match the kitchen, this new home is warm, inviting and
        will certainly be the center of family conversations in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our first modifications included removing a partition wall to open up
        the kitchen and dining room areas
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the space was opened up we removed the existing cabinetry and
        installed Diamond Intrigue all wood base wall cabinets. To accent the
        cabinets, there is also a 60" wall pantry and a broom closet with
        all-wood construction. The doors are a Paloma Maple in Sterling white
        with matching crown moulding.
      </p>
      <p>
        The kitchen is accented by spectacular black-honed granite countertops
        on the island and walls with a glass mosaic backsplash. We also placed
        new sheetrock to smooth the finish the ceiling throughout the rooms and
        installed stunning brushed nickel lighting
      </p>
      <p>
        With over 900 sq. feet of hardwood flooring, Mr. Fix It refinished the
        work and finished off the job with a complete makeover of the brick
        fireplace. The original fieplace was transformed into a attractive wood
        finish with a wood mantel, a decorative trim with matching crown
        moulding. The hearth and the side walls were also fitted with Absolute
        Black-Honed Granite to compliment the kitchen and serve as the
        centerpiece for this elegant new living space from Mr. Fix It Home
        Improvements.
