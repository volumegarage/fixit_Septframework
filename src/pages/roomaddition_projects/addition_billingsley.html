        This backyard in Ridgefields was recently transformed by Mr. Fix It
        Homes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our craftsmen converted this screen room into a 20×14 sunroom with a
        cathedral ceiling and new hardwood floors to match the kitchen and
        upstairs decor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Premium double-hung Atrium windows with Low-E supreme argon gas to
        reduce both glare and improve energy efficiency. For extra strength and
        support, we added new beams for the floor span.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the sunroom we also added a new deck 14×12 with porcelain
        tile and matching hand rails to match the sunroom.
      </p>
