testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

        Mr. Fix It Home Improvements worked with the homeowners to imagine a
        warm sunroom with tiled floor that overlooks the property on all sides.
        A custom wood ceiling features hanging fans and a side entrance as well
        as entrance from the upper floors of the home. A great place to read,
        relax and share family conversations.
