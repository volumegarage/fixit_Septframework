testimonial: When we started to look for contractors, we were worried about people being inside our house. Mr. Fix It and their entire crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed through the whole process. They were clean, professional and we couldn't be happier.

      <p>This Master Bath Addition could be your home.</p>
      <p>
        Additions like this add value to your home and make a difference each
        and every day. Mr. Fix It Home improvements recently completed this 12'
        x 10' Master Bath addition for this home in Mount Carmel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working from the back of the house, we constructed this bath from the
        ground up â€“ footers to the shingles, and everything in between.
      </p>
      <p>
        This master bath now compliments a rear bedroom and features a 60"x36"
        shower unit, twin 36" vanities and a 24" linen closet.
      </p>

      <p>
        All plywood American Heartwood cabinetry are accented by oil rubbed
        bronze hardware. There's a solid surface countertop with a rolled edge
        and dual mirrors and vanity lighting. We also added a separate room and
        water line for a private bathroom with a Koehler Hi-line commode.
      </p>

      <p>
        You have to experience to appreciate the solid construction. When you
        walk in, the 12"x24" porcelain floor tile and flooring is solid as a
        rock foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the outside, it looks like a natural extension of this home, and
        it's built to last with vinyl siding and a soffit exterior finish with
        continuous aluminum gutter and downspouts. Call Mr. Fix It Home
